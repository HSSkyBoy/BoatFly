This Fabric mod project is a **code refactoring** of [EricGilerson's BoatFly](https://github.com/EricGilerson/BoatFly), **as opposed to a simple build**, and is dedicated to maintaining compatibility with Minecraft 1.21 and above.

# Boat Fly
A simple client-side Fabric mod that allows you to pilot boats and fly freely through the air, with fully customisable speed.
This mod may be considered a modification of game mechanics, and its use on **non-anarchy** servers (e.g., [Hypixel](us.hypixlel.net)) may result in an **account ban**. Please be sure to use it with a full understanding of the risks involved.

### üö§ Features
   * **Flight Toggle**: Easily switch between normal boat mode and flight mode with a single keypress.
   * **Speed Control**: Adjust the boat's flight speed at any time whilst in flight.
   * **Vertical Control**: Use the jump key to ascend. When released, the boat will descend due to gravity.
   * **Client-Side Only**: This mod runs entirely on the client; no server installation is required. (Actual effectiveness may vary depending on the server's anti-cheat plugins).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Controls & Settings
All keybinds can be changed in Minecraft's 'Controls' menu.
